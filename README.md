# SnakeAndLadder
Snake and Ladder is a traditional board game played with dice and tokens. Players take turns rolling the dice and move their tokens along numbered squares. Ladders allow players to advance to higher squares, while landing on a snake sends them back. The goal is to reach the final square first.
